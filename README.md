# FC50-Midi-Controller
MidiController based on a Boss FC-50 and an Arduino.

Got a Boss FC-50 (pretty beaten up) and turned it into a working and silent controller that did what I needed it do. (silent => footswitches don't make any noise when pressed)

# Features:
- PC-Mode: every footswitch sends ProgramChange at first press, second and following press becomes tap-tempo
- CC-Mode
- Looper Mode
- Song Mode
- 4 Expression Pedals

Unfortunately I have no FC-50 at the moment, so no updates. Just putting it out there for you guys who do want to use this (excellent) controller.
